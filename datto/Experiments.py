        Assign a given id to the same experimental condition every time for a consistent user experience.
        I.e. customer #15 will always be in the treatment condition.

        Parameters
        --------
        id: int
        conditions: numpy array
            E.g. ['treatment', 'control']
        proportions_by_conditions: numpy array

        random_state: int
            Divisor used for consistent assignment

        --------
